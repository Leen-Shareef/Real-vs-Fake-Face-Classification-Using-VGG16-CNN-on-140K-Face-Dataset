# Real-vs-Fake-Face-Classification-Using-VGG16-CNN-on-140K-Face-Dataset
A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Binary Image Classification
In an era where digital media is easily manipulated, distinguishing between real and synthetic human faces has become both a technical challenge and a societal concern.  The rise of AI-generated faces - such as those produced by GANs  (Generative Adversarial Networks) - poses risks ranging from misinformation to identity fraud. The aim of this project is to build a deep learning-based image classification system capable of identifying whether a given facial image is real (captured from actual human faces) or fake (AI-generated).
This is a binary classification problem, with two clearly defined classes:
-	Class 0 - Real Faces: Genuine facial images of real people.
-	Class 1 - Fake Faces: AI-generated faces (from tools like ThisPersonDoesNotExist).
The input to the system is a facial image, and the output is a predicted label (0 or 1) indicating whether the face is real or fake. The goal is to train a robust model that generalizes well to unseen images and can achieve high classification accuracy despite subtle differences between classes.
Solving this problem has practical applications in digital forensics, social media integrity, and cybersecurity.
